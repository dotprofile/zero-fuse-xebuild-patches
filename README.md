# zero-fuse-xebuild-patches
Additional patches for Zero Fuse Xbox 360 consoles, the aim is to port more dash versions to Zero Fuse consoles

I want to make it clear that I am just some literal who with a lot of persistence. All I have done here is line up the vfuse/flag fixer/hvFixKeys patches for the most part. 

I got a LOT of info from the following, none of this would have been possible without these nice people/repos:

https://github.com/XboxChef/RGLoader

https://github.com/GoobyCorp/Xbox-360-Crypto/
